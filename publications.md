>**Abstract:**  
>A fraud score for a transaction in connection with an account is computed from retrieved data to indicate a probability of the account being in a compromised condition. A travel score is computed, wherein the computed travel score indicates a likelihood that a user of the account is traveling from a user home location at the time of the received transaction. A self-similarity score may be computed if the computed fraud score is above a predetermined threshold to indicate similarity of the received transaction to other transactions of the account in the set of prior transactions. A suggested action is determined, based on a fraud decisioning operation (and optionally the self-similarity score) and a travel decisioning operation using the fraud score and travel score, respectively.

>**Abstract:**  
>We develop a market-based mechanism that enables a building smart microgrid operator (SMO) to offer regulation service reserves and meet the associated obligation of fast response to commands issued by the wholesale market independent system operator (ISO) who provides energy and purchases reserves. The proposed market-based mechanism allows the SMO to control the behavior of internal loads through price signals and to provide feedback to the ISO. A regulation service reserves quantity is transacted between the SMO and the ISO for a relatively long period of time (e.g., a one-hour-long time-scale). During this period the ISO follows shorter time-scale stochastic dynamics to repeatedly request from the SMO to decrease or increase its consumption. We model the operational task of selecting an optimal short time-scale dynamic pricing policy as a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes average SMO and ISO utility. We then formulate an associated nonlinear programming static problem that provides an upper bound on the optimal utility. We study an asymptotic regime in which this upper bound is shown to be tight and the static policy provides an efficient approximation of the dynamic pricing policy. Equally importantly, this framework allows us to optimize the long time-scale decision of determining the optimal regulation service reserve quantity. We demonstrate, verify and validate the proposed approach through a series of Monte Carlo simulations of the controlled system time trajectories.

>**Abstract:**  
>We study the energy efficient implementation of averaging/consensus algorithms in wireless sensor networks. For static, time-invariant topologies we start from the recent result that a bidirectional spanning tree is preferable in terms of convergence time. We formulate the combinatorial optimization problem of selecting such a minimal energy tree as a mixed integer linear programming problem. Since the problem is NP-complete we devise a semi-definite relaxation and establish bounds on the optimal cost. We also develop a series of graph-based algorithms that yield energy efficient bidirectional spanning trees and establish associated bounds on the optimal cost. For dynamic, time-varying topologies we consider a recently proposed load-balancing algorithm which has preferable convergence time properties. We formulate the problem of selecting a minimal energy interconnected network over which we can run the algorithm as a sequential decision problem and cast it into a dynamic programming framework. We first consider the scenario of a large enough time horizon and show that the problem is equivalent to constructing a Minimum Spanning Tree. We then consider the scenario of a limited time horizon and employ a "rollout" heuristic that leverages the spanning tree solution and yields efficient solutions for the original problem. Some of our algorithms can be run in a distributed manner and numerical results establish that they produce near-optimal solutions.

>**Abstract:**  
>We study the energy costs of running a distributed averaging/consensus algorithm in a dynamic, time-varying wireless sensor network. It has been recently shown in Olshevsky and Tsitsiklis [2009] that running a load-balancing algorithm over a symmetric interconnected network is preferable in terms of convergence time. We formulate the problem of selecting a minimal energy interconnected network as a sequential decision problem and cast it into a Dynamic Programming (DP) framework. This problem is hard to solve, especially when incurring a penalty cost for not reaching interconnectivity within a pre-determined block of time. We first consider the scenario of a large enough time horizon and show that solving the DP is equivalent to constructing a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), which can be done in a distributed manner. We then consider the scenario of a limited time horizon and employ a “rollout” heuristic that leverages the MST solution and yields efficient solutions for the original DP. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms.

>**Abstract:**  
>This paper proposes a hybrid algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) for a multiobjective permutation flow shop scheduling problem, which is a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with strong engineering backgrounds. Not only does the proposed multiobjective algorithm (named MOPSO) apply the parallel evolution mechanism of PSO characterized by individual improvement, population cooperation, and competition to effectively perform exploration but it also utilizes several adaptive local search methods to perform exploitation. First, to make PSO suitable for solving scheduling problems, a ranked-order value (ROV) rule based on a random key technique to convert the continuous position values of particles to job permutations is presented. Second, a multiobjective local search based on the Nawaz-Enscore-Ham heuristic is applied to good solutions with a specified probability to enhance the exploitation ability. Third, to enrich the searching behavior and to avoid premature convergence, a multiobjective local search based on simulated annealing with multiple different neighborhoods is designed, and an adaptive meta-Lamarckian learning strategy is employed to decide which neighborhood will be used. Due to the fusion of multiple different searching operations, good solutions approximating the real Pareto front can be obtained. In addition, MOPSO adopts a random weighted linear sum function to aggregate multiple objectives to a single one for solution evaluation and for guiding the evolution process in the multiobjective sense. Due to the randomness of weights, searching direction can be enriched, and solutions with good diversity can be obtained. Simulation results and comparisons based on a variety of instances demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of the proposed hybrid algorithm.

>**Introduction:**  
>In this chapter, quantum-inspired genetic algorithms are proposed for permutation flow shop scheduling, which is a typical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem with strong engineering background. For the singleobjective scheduling problems, a hybrid quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (HQGA) is developed to achieve more satisfactory performance. In the HQGA, a quantum-inspired GA (QGA) based on Q-bit representation is applied for exploration in discrete 0-1 hyperspace by using updating operator of quantum gate as well as genetic operators of Q-bit. And the random key representation is used to convert the Q-bit representation to job permutation for evaluating the objective value of the schedule solution. Moreover, a permutation-based GA (PGA) is applied for both performing exploration in permutation-based scheduling space and stressing exploitation for good schedule solutions. The HQGA can be viewed as a fusion of micro-space based search (Q-bit based search) and macro-space based search (permutation-based search). For the multi-objective scheduling problems, some special strategies are utilized on the basis of the HQGA for single-objective scheduling. In particular, the randomly weighted linear sum function is used in the QGA to evaluate solutions in multi-objective sense, and a non-dominated sorting technique including classification of Pareto front and fitness assignment is applied in the PGA regarding to both proximity and diversity. In addition, two trimming techniques for population are proposed and applied in the HQGA to maintain diversity of population. Simulations are carried out based on several single-objective and multi-objective benchmarks with some performance metrics. The results and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid quantuminspired genetic algorithms.
