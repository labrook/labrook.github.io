My name is Binbin Li. I am currently a Data Science Manager at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com), also known as [Meta](https://www.meta.com). I am with the Facebook Ads Backend & Systems Analytics team in the Ads & Business Products org. I lead / have led mutliple data science teams, including 

- Ads Personalization DS team in Ads Core ML: feature & data for ~300 ads ranking models across Meta ecosystem ads surfaces (Facebook blue app, news feed, Instagram etc.)
- Ads ML Infrafoudation DS team: feature (GSF/GFF/F3) and model traing platforms (DPer3/Pytorch)
- Ads ML Automation DS team: MasterCook/LineCook model development processess and AutoML/Blueprint platforms
- Ads ML Privacy Experimentaton: A/B test also internally known as QRT under multiple signal loss scenarios such as App Tracking Transparency (ATT), Online Behavioral Advertising (OBA), ePrivacy Directive (ePD) etc.

### Previous Experience

Before [Facebook](https://www.meta.com), I was Head of Data Science at [true[X]](https://www.truex.com), a technology company building the next generation of advertising products and experiences for premium video. Ranked as one of [the world's most innovative companies](https://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2019/sectors/video), true[X] was a subsidiary of the formerly [21st Century Fox](https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/21cf/), and later part of [The Walt Disney Company](https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/). During my time with true[X] / Disney, I led a team of very talented data scientists, machine learning engineers and software engineers to build:

- **[UP//LIFT](https://www.truex.com/publishers.html#Uplift) Optimize**, an intelligent ad decisioning engine powered by machine learning models that assess how consumers are reacting to a brand in real time, match the right consumers to the right ads, and optimize performance of ad campaigns running on true[X]'s ad platform. [Independent study](./doc/press/Magna-IPG-Lab-TrueX-Humans-vs.-Machines-1.pdf) demonstrates that our machine learning models ["dramatically increase brand familiarity, brand interest, and purchase consideration"](https://magnaglobal.com/media_trials/the-humans-vs-the-machines/).

- **[UP//LIFT](https://www.truex.com/publishers.html#Uplift) Monitor**, an industry-leading online survey sampling and collection system that correctly and precisely measures performance of ad campaigns on and off true[X]'s ad networks. 

Before [true[X]](https://www.truex.com), I worked for [KPMG US](https://home.kpmg/us/en/home.html) as a Data Scientist Manager at [KPMG Lighthouse - Center of Excellency in Data & Analytics](https://advisory.kpmg.us/services/data-analytics.html), where I delivered novel machine learning and artificial intelligence models to help clients turn data into value. Clients included [Freddie Mac](http://www.freddiemac.com) and [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.jnj.com). 

Before [KPMG](https://home.kpmg/us/en/home.html), I worked at [SAS Instituite](https://www.sas.com) and led the core data science team of [SAS Fraud Management Solution](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/fraud-management.html), the industry leading real-time fraud management system to combat credit/debit card and online banking fraud. We had built real time fraud detection models for major top-tier banks all over the world, and helped clients prevent fraud loss of hundreds of millions dollars. If you live in the US and have a credit/debit card, chances are the neural networks models we build are/were pretecting you and your wealth from fraud.

Before [SAS](https://www.sas.com), I interned at the [Market Risk Modeling Group](https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/divisions/risk/) of [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/), where I developed a new algorithm up and running in prouduction to generate large dimensional, highly correlated time series for missing market data and to recover real data correlations.

### Education

I obtained my Ph.D. in [Systems Engineering](http://www.bu.edu/systems/) (a multidisciplinary research field particularly on Optimization, Control, Operations Research, and Machine Learning), and M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yannis Paschalidis](http://sites.bu.edu/paschalidis/people/yannis-paschalidis/). I also hold a M.Sc. degree in Control Science and Engineering, and a B.Sc. degree in Automation from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), Beijing, China, working with [Prof. Ling Wang](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/auen/1713/2011/20110919083200742395822/20110919083200742395822_.html). I have broad research interests in the areas of Optimization, Control, Operations Research, Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning (including Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning / Neuro-Dynamic Programming), and Artificial Intelligence. I have published four IEEE Transactions journal papers, four academic society flagship conference papers, one book chapter, and filed two patents, all in the aforementioned research areas.
