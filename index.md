My name is Binbin Li. I am currently the Head of Data Science at [true[X]](https://www.truex.com), one of [the world's most innovative companies](https://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2019/sectors/video). True[X] is a subsidiary of the formerly [21st Century Fox](https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/21cf/), now part of [The Walt Disney Company](https://www.thewaltdisneycompany.com/). I am privileged to work with a team of talented data scientists and software engineers to build:

- **UP//LIFT Optimize**, an intelligent ad decisioning engine powered by machine learning models that assess how consumers are reacting to a brand in real time, match the right consumers to the right ads, and optimize performance of ad campaigns running on true[X]'s ad platform. [Independent stduy](./doc/press/Magna-IPG-Lab-TrueX-Humans-vs.-Machines-1.pdf) demonstrates that our machine learning models ["dramatically increase brand familiarity, brand interest, and purchase consideration"](https://magnaglobal.com/media_trials/the-humans-vs-the-machines/).

- **UP//LIFT Monitor**, an industry-leading online survey sampling and collection system that correctly and precisely measures performance of ad campaigns on and off true[X]'s ad networks.

### Previous Experience

Before [true[X]](https://www.truex.com), I worked for [KPMG US](https://home.kpmg/us/en/home.html) as a Data Scientist Manager at [KPMG Lighthouse - Center of Excellency in Data & Analytics](https://advisory.kpmg.us/services/data-analytics.html), where I delivered novel machine learning and artificial intelligence models to help clients turn data into value. 

Before [KPMG](https://home.kpmg/us/en/home.html), I worked at [SAS Instituite](https://www.sas.com) and led the core data science team of [SAS Fraud Management Solution](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/fraud-management.html), the industry leading real-time fraud management system to combat credit/debit card and online banking fraud. We had built real time fraud detection models for major top-tier banks all over the world, and helped clients prevent fraud loss of hundreds of millions dollars. If you live in the US and have a credit/debit card, chances are the neural networks models we build are/were pretecting you and your wealth from fraud.

Before [SAS](https://www.sas.com), I interned at the [Market Risk Modeling Group](https://www.goldmansachs.com/careers/divisions/risk/) of [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/), where I developed a new algorithm up and running in prouduction to generate large dimensional, highly correlated time series for missing market data and to recover real data correlations.

### Education

I obtained my Ph.D. in Systems Engineering, and M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at [Boston University](http://www.bu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Yannis Paschalidis](http://sites.bu.edu/paschalidis/people/yannis-paschalidis/). I also hold a M.Sc. degree in Control Science and Engineering, and a B.Sc. degree in Automation from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn), Beijing, China, working with [Prof. Ling Wang](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/auen/1713/2011/20110919083200742395822/20110919083200742395822_.html). I have broad research interests in the areas of Optimization, Control, Operations Research, Evolutionary Computation, Machine Learning (including Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning / Neuro-Dynamic Programming), and Artificial Intelligence. I have published four IEEE Transactions journal papers, four academic society flagship conference papers, one book chapter, and filed two patents, all in the aforementioned research areas.

### Technical Competencies

- **Programming Languages:**  Python, Scala, Perl, C, C++, Shell Script, SQL
- **Statistical & Optimization Languages:** SAS, R, ILOG CPLEX, ATLAS/LINPACK
- **Cloud Platform & Big Data:** AWS, GCP, Databricks, Apache Open Source Software (Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Flink etc.)
